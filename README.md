 <h1 align  = "center">Rocket League Esports Analysis</h1>

The Data Analytics for Rocket League Esports project focuses on analyzing game data to help professional players improve their team's performance in the game of Rocket League. By gathering data from replay files of previous matches, the project provides valuable insights into various aspects of the game, including demolitions, ball possession, shots, goals, assists, and their impact on the overall match outcome.


## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to support professional players in optimizing their gameplay by identifying areas of improvement and providing data-driven insights. By analyzing the relationships between different factors such as demolitions, ball possession, shots, and goals, the project aims to uncover patterns and trends that can help players make strategic decisions during matches.
## Key Questions Explored

The project addresses the following key questions:

1. How do demolitions relate to ball possession, and how does this impact the match outcome (win/lose)?

2. What is the correlation between demolitions in the last 20% of a match and its outcome, and how does this influence the final result of the game?

3. How do shots and assists relate to goals, and what impact does this have on the match outcome (win/lose)?

4. How does average time in the attacking half relate to shots, and what impact does this have on the match outcome (win/lose)?

5. How does ball possession relate to shots and assists, and what impact does this have on the match outcome?

6. How does boost relate to ball possession, and what impact does this have on the match outcome?
## Methodology and Analysis

The project utilizes Python and Jupyter Notebook for data processing, analysis, and visualization. It leverages the pandas library for data manipulation and normalization, matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations, and NumPy for mathematical computations.

The analysis involves extracting relevant data from Rocket League replay files and applying statistical techniques to uncover insights. Various visualizations such as bar graphs, pie charts, and correlation matrices are used to present the findings effectively.


## Findings and Insights

The analysis reveals interesting patterns and insights related to demolitions, ball possession, shots, goals, assists, and boost usage. These insights provide valuable information for professional players to improve their gameplay strategies and increase their chances of winning matches.

For example, the analysis shows a strong relationship between demolitions and ball possession, indicating that demolitions often lead to a change in possession. The impact of demolitions in the last 20% of a match is found to be significant, influencing the final outcome.

Furthermore, the analysis highlights the importance of shots and assists in scoring goals and winning matches. Teams that take more shots and spend more time in the attacking half tend to have a higher chance of success.

The relationship between ball possession and various game actions such as shots and assists is explored, emphasizing the importance of controlling the ball for creating scoring opportunities.

Boost usage is also found to be closely related to ball possession and goals, indicating that teams with better boost control have a higher chance of scoring.
